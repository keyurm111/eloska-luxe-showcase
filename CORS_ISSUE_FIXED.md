# ✅ **CORS Issue Fixed!**

## 🔧 **Problem Identified:**
The error showed that the frontend was running on `http://localhost:8080` but the backend CORS configuration only allowed `http://localhost:5173`.

**Error Message:**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5004/api/product-inquiries/submit' from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://localhost:3001' that is not equal to the supplied origin.
```

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### **Updated CORS Configuration**
Added `http://localhost:8080` to the allowed origins in the backend server:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: [
    process.env.FRONTEND_URL || 'http://localhost:3001',
    'http://localhost:5173', // Vite dev server (main website)
    'http://localhost:8080', // Alternative Vite dev server port ← ADDED
    'http://localhost:3000'  // Alternative React dev server
  ],
  credentials: true
}));
```

### **Server Restart**
- Killed the existing server process
- Restarted the backend server with updated CORS configuration
- Verified the server is running correctly on port 5004

## 🧪 **Testing Results:**

### **API Endpoint Test**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5004/api/product-inquiries/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:8080" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com",...}'
```

**Result:** ✅ **SUCCESS** - API responded correctly

### **Server Status**
- ✅ Backend running on port 5004
- ✅ CORS configured for localhost:8080
- ✅ API endpoints working
- ✅ Database connected

## 🚀 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **CORS Issue**: Fixed
